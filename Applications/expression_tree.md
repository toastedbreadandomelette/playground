# Expression Tree
Expression trees are a way to solve a mathematical expression (for e.g., $((3\times 4)+6)\div 12)$.  Each of these operations defined between two numbers has a precedence: with a certain priority, given below from highest.
- Bracket operations
- Power function, will be denoting as 2^3 (which is $2^3$).
- $\div, \times$ operator
- $+, -$ operator.

With this in mind, the expression tree is generated.
