# Statistics

## Mean
Mean is the sum of all the numbers divided by total numbers (basically an [[basic_maths_2#Arithmetic mean of a number/series|Arithmetic mean]]).
 $\therefore AM(A)=\dfrac{\sum\limits_{i=1}^n a_i}{n}=\dfrac{a_1+a_2+a_3+\ldots+a_n}{n}$.

## Median
Median is a number or value in the dataset that, iff sorted in ascending order by it's value, that value divides the dataset in two sets.

i.e., in set $A,\ A_i<A_{i+1}\ \forall\  i\in[1,|A|],\ 1\leq i\leq |A|$, median $Me(A)$ is defined as:
$$
Me(A)=\left\{\begin{array}{cl}
A_{k},&k=\dfrac{|A|+1}2,\ |A|\equiv1\pmod2\\
\dfrac{A_{k_1}+A_{k_2}}2,&k_1=\dfrac{|A|}2,\ k_2=\dfrac{|A|+1}2,\ |A|\equiv0\pmod2
\end{array}
\right.
$$
## Mode
Mode is a observation value in dataset that occurs most of the time in the dataset.
