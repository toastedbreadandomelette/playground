# Abelian Group
Abelian group (or commutative group) are set of operations group that after applying, the results turns out to be same...?

- Commutative: Result is consistent even after $(a\cdot b)\cdot c=a\cdot (b\cdot c)$
- Identity: An element $e$ such that $(a\cdot e)=(e\cdot a)=1$
- Inverse Element: There exists and element $b$ such that $(a\cdot b)=(b\cdot a)=e$
- Associative: $(a\cdot b)=(b\cdot a)$
