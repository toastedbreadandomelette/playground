# Line
Line is defined as long object with length $=\infty$ and no width, height or curve.

## Line in $2$-Dimensional Field (Plane)

### Equation of line

$$ax+by+c=0$$

Set of valid lines are infinite points where it satisfies the given equation:

$$L=\lbrace(x,y)\ |\ ax+by+c=0,\ a,b,c\in\mathbb{R}\rbrace$$

These equations can also be written as

$$y=mx+c$$

A slope-intercept form of equation, where $m$ is slope and $c$ is value such that $(0,c)$ is point on the line. 

A line can also be defined by extending segment of line generated by shortest distance between two points $(x_1,y_1)$ and $(x_2,y_2)$ . Knowing that generated points $(x,y)$ should be collinear, we get the equation:

$$\dfrac{y-y_1}{x-x_1}=\dfrac{y_2-y_1}{x_2-x_1}$$
Finding similarities with equation $y=mx+c$ :

$$
\begin{matrix}
y&=&\dfrac{y_2-y_1}{x_2-x_1}\cdot x+\dfrac{x_1\cdot y_1-x_1\cdot y_2}{x_2-x_1}+y_1\\
&=&\dfrac{y_2-y_1}{x_2-x_1}\cdot x+\dfrac{x_2\cdot y1-x_1\cdot y_2}{x_2-x_1}\\
&=&m\cdot x+c
\end{matrix}
$$

Finding similarities with equation $ax+by+c=0$ :

$$
\begin{matrix}
y&=&\dfrac{y_2-y_1}{x_2-x_1}\cdot x+\dfrac{x_2\cdot y1-x_1\cdot y_2}{x_2-x_1}\\
\implies (x_2-x_1)\cdot y&=&(y_2-y_1)\cdot x+(x_2\cdot y_1-x_1\cdot y_2)\\
(y_1-y_2)\cdot x+(x_2-x_1)\cdot y+(x_1\cdot y_2-x_2\cdot y_1)&=&0\\
a\cdot x+b\cdot y + c&=&0
\end{matrix}
